Welcome to _OmnicoinJ_, a Java implementation of the Omnicoin protocol

Omnicoin is an experiment in the creation, implementation, and integration of a cryptocurrency with MyBB community software in mind. 
Originally created by a member of HackForums.net it's grown beyond that initial ideal and has moved into a wider realm of possibility. 
With a new launch of version 2 (OMCv2), a new team, and renewed focus Omnicoin promises to gain ground which no other crypto currency has tread.

Things that still need updating:
* omnicoinj\core\src\main\java\com\google\bitcoin\core\CoinDefinition.java
* The checkDifficultyTransitions method must be updated in AbstractBlockChain to match the GetNextWorkRequired function in the C++ code
